docfest_scraper
===============

[SF IndieFest](http://sfindie.com/connect/) holds an annual documentary festival called [Docfest](http://sfindie.com/festivals/sf-docfest/). Unfortunately, the schedule on their website isn't in a usable format. I wrote this scraper to scrape the film screening schedule and store the data as json.

The data can then be manipulated and imported into a variety of calendar programs, but I structured it specifically for use with the [Google Calendar API](https://gist.github.com/mcmguaba/5640569).
